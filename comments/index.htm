        <td>I just played your new game Crisis Wolverine: Insurrection Green from 
          start to finish, and it was the best three hours I have spent in a long 
          time. The game completely sucks you in, making you want to explore the 
          familiar landscape and find the jokes hidden within. Shortness and lack 
          of complexity can be both good and bad, but here only the good seems 
          to come through, leaving a nice, mint-like aftertaste. While playing, 
          I sometimes thought that it was too easy, I mean I only had one party 
          member die in the whole game. However, this ease certainly makes the 
          game much less frustrating, and allows you to focus on the story, and 
          the jokes. The length is also a blessing in disguise, I like Final Fantasy 
          as much as the next red-blooded gamer, but sometimes I don't want to 
          commit 60 or more hours to a game with a streched-to-the-breaking-point 
          stroyline. Anyway, great game, recommending it to all my friends, and 
          planning to donate (really, I just need to borrow someone's paypal account). 
          Here's the short quote I use to plug the game: "www.criseswolverine.com 
          has released an old school RPG (think an early Final Fantasy) set on 
          campus that everyone with a PC should check out. Short (my first time 
          through was just 3 hours), Simple (use the druggie's Dark to blind enemies 
          so they can't attack), but most assuredly sweet. Totally engrossing." 
          hope you don't mind. Thanks for the game, it is truely great work. <b>

            on as the end the semester approaches, i couldn't stop playing the 
            game. i think anyone who has been to these locations on campus will 
            appreciate the pure genius in their representations in the game. and 
            some of the jokes and references were just classic. so thanks to all, 
            i hope there is a sequel. <b>B.M.</b></div>
